    <h1>Chronology of Star Trek</h1>
    <p>Starfleet has always been about more than just starships and warp drives—it’s about curiosity, courage, and the relentless 
        pursuit of the unknown. From Earth’s first steps into deep space to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, this 
        page dives into the incredible journey that shaped Starfleet into the organization we know today.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each timeframe represents an iconic era in Starfleet history. Discover the captains, officers, and events that defined these
        moments, from the early days of exploration to a leap into the 32nd century. Compiled in chronological order, this timeline is a
        map of the Federation's evolution.
