    <h1>Chronology of Star Trek</h1>
    <p>Starfleet has always been about more than just starships and warp drives—it’s about curiosity, courage, and the relentless 
        pursuit of the unknown. From Earth’s first steps into deep space to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, this 
        page dives into the incredible journey that shaped Starfleet into the organization we know today.
        Discover how legendary captains and crews helped expand the Federation, the technological breakthroughs that made 
        interstellar travel possible, and the defining moments that changed Starfleet forever. Whether you're here to learn about 
        first contact missions, historic battles, or the ideals that guide Starfleet's explorers, there's always something new to 
        uncover.
